## Description

Welcome to the quiz game I created! Once you click the start button, you will switch to a question page where you will be presented with a question and 4 possible answers. 

Clicked answers are compared against the correct answer by comparing innerHTML elements to the correct answer. Correct answers will cause their score to raise by 1. Your score will remain the same and your seconds left will detract 5 seconds if you are incorrect. Both correct and incorrect answers will load the next question until question 10. 

Then you will be presented with your final score, on the end screen, and you can input your initials and score to a highscore page. This page stores the last set of highscore details.

## Visuals

The following layout is what you can expect to see on your browser.
